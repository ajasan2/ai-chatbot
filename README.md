This is a full-stack MERN project that integrates Google's Gemini AI to provide a chatbot service. The project is divided into two main parts: the client-side and the server-side.

## Client

The client-side of the application is built with React. It is located inside the server directory under the `client` folder. It uses Vite for a build tool and Tailwind CSS for styling. The main entry point of the application is `main.jsx`. The application's components are located in the `components` directory.

## Server

The server-side of the application is built with Node.js and Express. It uses MongoDB as a database, with Mongoose for object modeling. The main entry point of the server is `server.js`. The server's routes are located in the `routes` directory, and the controllers are located in the `controllers` directory.

## üöÄ Installation

To install the dependencies for the client and server, navigate to the server directory and run `npm run build`.

## üñ•Ô∏è Running the Application Locally

Before running the application locally, you need to set up your environment variables in a `.env` file in the server directory. The file should contain the following:

- `API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini's API key
- `JWT_KEY`: Your phrase for JSON Web Token
- `DB_URI`: Your MongoDB database URI

Once you have set up your `.env` file, you can start the application by navigating to the server directory and executing the following command: `npm run start`.
